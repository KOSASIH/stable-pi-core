# Workflow Descriptions

This document provides detailed descriptions of each workflow in the RPA Automation Project. Each workflow is designed to automate specific tasks and improve overall efficiency.

## 1. DataExtraction.xaml

### Description
The `DataExtraction.xaml` workflow is responsible for extracting data from various sources, including web applications and databases. It retrieves the necessary information and stores it in a structured format for further processing.

### Key Features
- Connects to specified data sources.
- Extracts data based on predefined criteria.
- Handles exceptions during the extraction process.
- Logs the results of the extraction.

### Input Parameters
- **SourceType**: The type of data source (e.g., Web, Database).
- **Query**: The query or criteria used for data extraction.

### Output
- **ExtractedData**: A DataTable containing the extracted data.

## 2. DataEntry.xaml

### Description
The `DataEntry.xaml` workflow automates the process of entering data into specified applications or systems. It takes the extracted data and populates the relevant fields in the target application.

### Key Features
- Reads data from the provided DataTable.
- Navigates to the target application.
- Fills in the required fields with the extracted data.
- Validates successful data entry and logs the results.

### Input Parameters
- **DataToEnter**: A DataTable containing the data to be entered.
- **TargetApplication**: The application where the data will be entered.

### Output
- **EntryStatus**: A string indicating the success or failure of the data entry process.

## 3. ErrorHandling.xaml

### Description
The `ErrorHandling.xaml` workflow is designed to manage errors that occur during the execution of other workflows. It captures exceptions, logs error details, and implements recovery strategies.

### Key Features
- Centralized error handling for all workflows.
- Logs detailed error messages and stack traces.
- Sends notifications in case of critical errors.
- Implements retry logic for recoverable errors.

### Input Parameters
- **ErrorMessage**: The message associated with the error.
- **WorkflowName**: The name of the workflow where the error occurred.

### Output
- **ErrorLogged**: A boolean indicating whether the error was successfully logged.

## 4. TestEndToEnd.xaml

### Description
The `TestEndToEnd.xaml` workflow validates the entire automation process from start to finish. It simulates the complete workflow and checks that all components work together as expected.

### Key Features
- Simulates data extraction, processing, and entry.
- Validates the final result against expected outcomes.
- Logs the success or failure of the end-to-end test.

### Input Parameters
- **ExpectedResult**: The expected outcome of the entire process.

### Output
- **TestResult**: A string indicating whether the end-to-end test passed or failed.

## 5. TestErrorHandling.xaml

### Description
The `TestErrorHandling.xaml` workflow validates the error handling mechanisms within the automation process. It simulates errors and checks that they are handled correctly.

### Key Features
- Simulates an error during the data extraction process.
- Validates that the error is logged and handled appropriately.
- Checks the result of the error handling process.

### Input Parameters
- **SimulatedError**: The type of error to simulate.

### Output
- **ErrorHandlingResult**: A string indicating whether the error handling test passed or failed.
