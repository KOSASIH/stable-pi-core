# Cosmic Radiation Hardened AI (CRHAI)

The Cosmic Radiation Hardened AI (CRHAI) module is designed to ensure that AI systems can operate effectively in space environments, where they are exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation. This module leverages radiation-hardened materials and redundant AI architectures to maintain functionality and reliability, supporting all AI functions of the Stable-Pi-Core project in orbit or beyond.

## Features

- **Radiation-Hardened AI**: AI models designed to withstand cosmic radiation effects.
- **Redundant Architecture**: Multiple AI models running in parallel to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
- **Edge Computing**: Local data processing capabilities for real-time decision-making, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
- **Configurable Settings**: Flexible configuration options for logging, model count, and edge computing settings.

## Installation

To set up the CRHAI module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/crhai
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the configuration**:
   Create a `crhai_config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "LOGGING_LEVEL": "INFO",
       "MODEL_COUNT": 3,
       "EDGE_COMPUTING_ENABLED": true
   }
   ```

## Usage

To use the CRHAI module, you can initialize the AI and edge computing components in your application:

```python
from crhai import RadiationHardenedAI, EdgeComputing

# Initialize components
ai_system = RadiationHardenedAI(model_count=3)
edge_computer = EdgeComputing()

# Example input data for prediction
input_data = {"sensor_reading": 42}

# Make a prediction using the AI system
prediction = ai_system.predict(input_data)
print(f"AI Prediction: {prediction}")

# Process data using edge computing
processed_data = edge_computer.process_data(input_data)
print(f"Processed Data: {processed_data}")
```

## Components

- **Radiation Hardened AI**: Implements redundant AI models that can withstand cosmic radiation and make predictions based on input data.
- **Edge Computing**: Provides local data processing capabilities to analyze data and make decisions in real-time.

## Configuration

The CRHAI module uses a JSON configuration file (`crhai_config.json`) to manage settings. You can customize parameters such as logging levels, the number of AI models, and whether edge computing is enabled.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the CRHAI module, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s crhai/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and report the results.
