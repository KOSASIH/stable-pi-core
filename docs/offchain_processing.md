# Off-Chain Processing Documentation

## Overview

The off-chain processing module is designed to handle complex computations and data management outside the blockchain environment. This module integrates with IPFS for decentralized storage and interacts with the Oracle smart contract to submit processed data. The key components of the off-chain processing system include:

- **IPFS Integration**: For storing and retrieving data.
- **Oracle Interaction**: For submitting processed data to the blockchain.
- **Edge Node Processing**: For executing off-chain tasks, including Quantum-AI analysis and RPA automation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Access to an Ethereum node (e.g., Infura)
- An IPFS node or access to a public IPFS service (e.g., Infura IPFS)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   INFURA_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
   PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
   ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Components

### IPFS Utilities

The `scripts/utils/ipfsUtils.js` file contains utility functions for interacting with IPFS, including storing and retrieving data.

- **storeData(data)**: Stores the provided data on IPFS and returns the CID.
- **retrieveData(cid)**: Retrieves data from IPFS using the provided CID.

### Off-Chain Processing Script

The `scripts/offchain_processing.js` file handles the main off-chain processing logic. It stores data on IPFS and submits it to the Oracle contract.

- **storeDataOnIPFS(data)**: Calls the `storeData` function to store data on IPFS.
- **submitDataToOracle(dataType, cid)**: Submits the CID to the Oracle contract.

### Edge Node Server

The `edge-nodes/edge-server.js` file sets up an Express server to handle incoming requests for off-chain processing.

- **POST /process**: Accepts JSON data containing `dataType` and `data`, processes it, and submits it to the Oracle contract.

### Quantum-AI Processor

The `edge-nodes/quantum-ai-processor.js` file simulates Quantum-AI analysis.

- **analyzeData(data, config)**: Performs quantum computation on the provided data.
- **classicalAIIntegration(data)**: Simulates integration with classical AI techniques.

### RPA Automation

The `edge-nodes/rpa-automation.js` file automates repetitive tasks such as data entry, web scraping, and API interactions.

- **automateDataEntry(data)**: Simulates data entry automation.
- **scrapeWebsite(url)**: Scrapes data from the specified website.
- **interactWithAPI(apiUrl, payload)**: Interacts with an external API.

## Usage

1. **Start the Edge Server**:
   ```bash
   node edge-nodes/edge-server.js
   ```

2. **Send a Request to Process Data**:
   Use a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a POST request to the `/process` endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dataType": "ETH/USD", "data": "3000"}'
   ```

## Examples

### Example of Off-Chain Processing

1. **Data Entry Automation**:
   The RPA automation script can be triggered to automate data entry tasks.

 2. **Web Scraping**:
   The off-chain processing can include web scraping to gather real-time data for analysis.

3. **Quantum-AI Analysis**:
   The Quantum-AI processor can be utilized to analyze complex datasets and provide insights.

### Example Request

To process data and submit it to the Oracle, you can use the following JSON structure in your request:

```json
{
  "dataType": "ETH/USD",
  "data": {
    "price": 3000,
    "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The off-chain processing module includes error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness:

- **IPFS Errors**: If data storage or retrieval fails, appropriate error messages will be logged.
- **Oracle Submission Errors**: If the submission to the Oracle contract fails, the system will retry the submission based on predefined logic.
- **Request Validation**: Incoming requests to the edge server are validated to ensure required fields are present.

## Conclusion

The off-chain processing module provides a powerful framework for handling complex computations and data management outside the blockchain. By leveraging IPFS for decentralized storage and integrating with Oracle smart contracts, this module enables efficient and scalable data processing solutions. The provided examples and usage instructions should help you get started with implementing off-chain processing in your projects. For further enhancements, consider integrating additional data sources or expanding the capabilities of the Quantum-AI processor.
