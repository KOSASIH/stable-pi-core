# Emotion-Responsive AI Module

## Overview

The Emotion-Responsive AI module is designed to detect and respond to user emotions in real-time. It integrates various technologies, including emotion detection from facial expressions and voice analysis, to create adaptive experiences in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Utilizes facial recognition and voice analysis to identify user emotions.
- **AR/VR Integration**: Adapts content in AR and VR environments based on detected emotions.
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data locally to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.
- **Data Storage**: Holographic storage for efficient data management and retrieval.

## Architecture

The Emotion-Responsive AI module consists of the following components:

1. **Emotion Detection**:
   - **Facial Emotion Detection**: Uses libraries like Affectiva or Google Cloud Vision to analyze facial expressions.
   - **Voice Emotion Analysis**: Analyzes voice input to detect emotions using libraries like librosa.

2. **AR/VR Integration**:
   - Adapts the user experience in AR/VR environments based on detected emotions.

3. **Edge Integration**:
   - Processes emotion detection data locally to enhance performance and reduce latency.

4. **Holographic Storage**:
   - Manages data storage and retrieval efficiently.

## Installation

To install the Emotion-Responsive AI module, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
cd stable-pi-core
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Initializing the Emotion-Responsive AI Module

To initialize the Emotion-Responsive AI module, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from emotion_responsive_ai import initialize_emotion_responsive_ai

initialize_emotion_responsive_ai()
```

### Detecting Emotions

To detect emotions from an image frame or audio input, use the following methods:

#### Facial Emotion Detection

```python
from emotion_responsive_ai.emotion_detection import EmotionDetection

emotion_detector = EmotionDetection(use_affectiva=True)  # Set to False for Google Cloud Vision
frame = ...  # Your image frame here
emotions = emotion_detector.detect_emotion(frame)
print(emotions)
```

#### Voice Emotion Analysis

```python
from emotion_responsive_ai.voice_emotion_analysis import VoiceEmotionAnalysis

voice_analyzer = VoiceEmotionAnalysis(use_affectiva=True)  # Set to False for Google Cloud Vision
audio_file = 'path/to/audio/file.wav'
emotions = voice_analyzer.analyze_voice(audio_file)
print(emotions)
```

### Integrating with AR/VR

To integrate emotion detection with AR/VR experiences, use the following code:

```python
from emotion_responsive_ai.ar_vr_integration import ARVRIntegration

arvr_integration = ARVRIntegration(emotion_detector)
frame = ...  # Your image frame here
arvr_integration.update_ar_vr_experience(frame)
```

### Edge Integration

To utilize edge computing for emotion detection, set up the edge integration as follows:

```python
from emotion_responsive_ai.edge_integration import EdgeIntegration

edge_integration = EdgeIntegration(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)
edge_integration.start_server()
```

## API Reference
