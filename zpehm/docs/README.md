# Zero-Point Energy Harvesting Module (ZPEHM)

## Overview

The Zero-Point Energy Harvesting Module (ZPEHM) is an advanced system designed to harness energy from zero-point fluctuations in the quantum vacuum. This module provides a powerful and sustainable energy source for satellite nodes and edge devices, enabling unprecedented energy efficiency and autonomy.

## Features

- **Dynamic Energy Harvesting**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to adaptively harvest energy based on environmental conditions.
- **Quantum Interface**: Interacts with quantum systems to manage quantum states and perform measurements.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides real-time status updates on energy collection and distribution.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows users to customize harvesting rates and efficiency through command-line arguments.
- **Multi-threaded Operations**: Supports concurrent energy harvesting and monitoring for optimal performance.

## Installation

To install the ZPEHM module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/zpehm
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Zero-Point Energy Harvesting Module, use the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py --harvesting_rate <rate> --efficiency <efficiency>
```

### Parameters

- `--harvesting_rate`: The rate of energy harvesting in Joules per second (default: 1.0).
- `--efficiency`: The base efficiency of the energy harvesting process (0 to 1, default: 0.85).

### Example Command

```bash
python src/main.py --harvesting_rate 1.5 --efficiency 0.90
```

## Components

### Energy Harvester

The `energy_harvester.py` file contains the `EnergyHarvester` class, which is responsible for:

- Harvesting energy from zero-point fluctuations.
- Adjusting efficiency based on environmental conditions.
- Distributing harvested energy to external systems.

### Quantum Interface

The `quantum_interface.py` file provides an interface for interacting with quantum systems, including:

- Preparing and measuring quantum states.
- Simulating entanglement of quantum states.
- Validating state vectors for quantum operations.

### Main Module

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the ZPEHM, coordinating the energy harvesting and monitoring processes. It allows users to configure parameters and provides real-time updates on energy collection.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

To see the module in action, you can run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will start the energy harvesting process with default parameters.

### Advanced Example

You can also create a custom quantum state and measure it using the Quantum Interface:

```python
from quantum_interface import QuantumInterface

qi = QuantumInterface()
state_vector = [1/np.sqrt(2), 1/np.sqrt(2)]  # Example: |+> state
qi.prepare_quantum_state(state_vector)
result = qi.measure_quantum_state()
print(f"Measurement Result: {result}")
```
