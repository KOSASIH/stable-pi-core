## Overview

The Interplanetary Transaction Protocol (ITP) is a specialized protocol that enables seamless transactions between different celestial entities. It leverages advanced technologies such as the Space-Time Synchronization Protocol (STSP) and Quantum Entanglement-Based Consensus (QGC) to ensure accurate timekeeping and secure consensus on transaction validity.

## Installation

To install the Stable-Pi-Core project, which includes the ITP, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/itp
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Getting Started

To begin using the ITP, you need to import the `InterplanetaryTransactionProtocol` class from the package:

```python
from itp.SRC.interplanetary_transaction_protocol import InterplanetaryTransactionProtocol
```

## Creating Transactions

You can create a transaction by specifying the sender, receiver, and amount. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
# Initialize the Interplanetary Transaction Protocol
itp = InterplanetaryTransactionProtocol()

# Create a transaction
transaction = itp.create_transaction("PlanetA", "PlanetB", 100)

# Print the created transaction
print(transaction)
```

### Transaction Structure

A transaction is represented as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    'sender': 'PlanetA',
    'receiver': 'PlanetB',
    'amount': 100,
    'status': 'pending',
    'timestamp': <timestamp>
}
```

## Processing Transactions

Once you have created transactions, you can process them using the `process_transactions` method:

```python
# Process all pending transactions
itp.process_transactions()

# Print all transactions
print(itp.get_all_transactions())
```

## Using Smart Contracts

The ITP supports the execution of smart contracts as part of the transaction process. You can specify a smart contract function when creating a transaction:

```python
def my_contract(transaction):
    # Logic for the smart contract
    return True  # Indicate success

# Create a transaction with a smart contract
transaction = itp.create_transaction("PlanetA", "PlanetB", 100, contract=my_contract)
itp.execute_transaction(transaction)
```

## Best Practices

- **Validate Transactions**: Always validate transactions before execution to ensure they meet the required criteria.
- **Use Smart Contracts Wisely**: Implement smart contracts to automate complex transaction logic, but ensure they are thoroughly tested.
- **Monitor Transactions**: Keep track of transaction statuses and logs to identify any issues promptly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Transaction Not Executing**: Ensure that the transaction is valid and meets all criteria. Check the logs for any validation errors.
- **Synchronization Issues**: If timestamps are not accurate, verify that the Space-Time Synchronization Protocol is functioning correctly.
