# Dark Matter Energy Converter (DMEC)

The Dark Matter Energy Converter (DMEC) is an advanced energy generation system that harnesses the hypothetical interactions of dark matter to produce energy. This project aims to explore innovative ways to generate sustainable energy for applications on Earth and in space.

## Features

- **Dark Matter Detection**: Simulates the detection of dark matter interactions with configurable sensitivity.
- **Energy Conversion**: Converts detected interactions into usable energy with multiple conversion strategies.
- **Data Handling**: Saves energy output data in JSON and CSV formats for easy analysis.
- **Communication**: Supports MQTT for real-time data transmission to edge nodes and satellites.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests for all major components to ensure reliability.

## Installation

To set up the DMEC module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/dmec
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the configuration**:
   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "DETECTOR_SENSITIVITY": 0.95,
       "DETECTION_INTERVAL": 1.0,
       "ENERGY_PER_INTERACTION": 1.0,
       "MQTT_BROKER_URL": "mqtt://broker.example.com",
       "MQTT_TOPIC": "dmec/energy_output",
       "LOGGING_ENABLED": true,
       "LOGGING_LEVEL": "DEBUG",
       "DATA_STORAGE_FORMAT": "json",
       "DATA_FILENAME": "energy_data.json",
       "CSV_FILENAME": "energy_data.csv"
   }
   ```

## Usage

To run the DMEC module, execute the main script:

```bash
python dmec/main.py
```

This will start the detection process, convert interactions into energy, and publish the results to the specified MQTT topic.

### Example

You can modify the sensitivity of the dark matter detector and observe how it affects energy output. The system will log all interactions and energy outputs.

## Components

- **Detector**: Responsible for simulating dark matter interactions.
- **Energy Converter**: Converts detected interactions into energy.
- **Data Handler**: Manages saving and loading energy output data.
- **Communication**: Handles real-time data transmission using MQTT.
- **Utilities**: Provides helper functions for logging, validation, and file handling.

## Configuration

The DMEC module uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to manage settings. You can customize parameters such as detector sensitivity, energy output per interaction, and logging levels.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the DMEC module, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s dmec/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and report the results.
