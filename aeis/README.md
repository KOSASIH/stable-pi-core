# Astro-Economic Incentive System (AEIS)

## Description

The Astro-Economic Incentive System (AEIS) is a cutting-edge economic incentive framework designed to reward satellite nodes and users who contribute to the expansion of the Stable-Pi-Core project into space. This system provides tokens to participants who support various activities, such as communication and data processing in orbit, thereby fostering collaboration and innovation in space-based applications.

## Features

- **Token Distribution**: Automatically distributes tokens to contributors based on their recorded contributions.
- **Dynamic Reward Calculation**: Adjusts rewards based on real-time data and external factors.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures secure and controlled access to critical functions within the system.
- **Batch Processing**: Supports batch recording of contributions and distribution of tokens for efficiency.
- **Event Logging**: Logs important actions and events for transparency and auditing.
- **Integration with External Oracles**: Fetches real-time data to enhance reward calculations and decision-making.
- **Emergency Stop Mechanism**: Allows the system to be paused in case of emergencies to prevent unauthorized actions.

## Installation

To set up the AEIS, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/aeis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Ethereum Node**:
   - You will need access to an Ethereum node. You can use services like Infura or Alchemy to create an account and obtain an API key.
   - Update the `aeis_config.yaml` file with your Ethereum node URL and the deployed contract address.

4. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   - Use Truffle or Hardhat to deploy the `AEIS.sol` smart contract to your desired Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet).
   - Update the `contract_address` in `aeis_config.yaml` with the deployed contract address.

## Usage

### Interacting with AEIS

You can interact with the AEIS using the provided `aeis_manager.py` script. Here are some example operations:

1. **Record a Contribution**:
   ```python
   from aeis.aeis_manager import AEISManager

   manager = AEISManager()
   manager.record_contribution("0xYourContributorAddress", 100)
   ```

2. **Distribute Tokens**:
   ```python
   manager.distribute_tokens("0xYourContributorAddress")
   ```

3. **Get Contribution**:
   ```python
   contribution = manager.get_contribution("0xYourContributorAddress")
   print(f"Contribution: {contribution}")
   ```

### Batch Operations

You can also perform batch operations for efficiency:

1. **Batch Record Contributions**:
   ```python
   contributions = [
       ("0xContributor1", 100),
       ("0xContributor2", 200),
   ]
   manager.record_contributions_batch(contributions)
   ```

2. **Batch Distribute Tokens**:
   ```python
   contributors = ["0xContributor1", "0xContributor2"]
   manager.distribute_tokens_batch(contributors)
   ```

## Configuration

The configuration for the AEIS is managed through the `aeis_config.yaml` file. You can adjust parameters such as:

- Ethereum node URL
- Contract address
- Reward percentages
- Logging settings
- External service configurations
