# Exo-Blockchain Synchronization (EBS)

The Exo-Blockchain Synchronization (EBS) module is an advanced system designed to facilitate communication and transactions with hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations. By leveraging quantum signal detection and adaptive protocols, EBS aims to synchronize data with external blockchain networks while ensuring security through AI-based analysis.

## Features

- **Quantum Signal Detection**: Detects signals from space using probabilistic methods.
- **Blockchain Synchronization**: Synchronizes data with external blockchain networks.
- **AI-Based Security Analysis**: Analyzes signals and data for anomalies and threats.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with the EBS module.
- **Configurable Settings**: Flexible configuration options for logging, detection thresholds, and synchronization attempts.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Installation

To set up the EBS module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/ebs
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the configuration**:
   Create a `ebs_config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "LOGGING_LEVEL": "INFO",
       "SIGNAL_DETECTION_THRESHOLD": 0.1,
       "MAX_SYNC_ATTEMPTS": 5,
       "AI_SECURITY_ENABLED": true
   }
   ```

## Usage

To run the EBS module, you can start the API server:

```bash
python ebs/api.py
```

### Example API Requests

1. **Detect Signal**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/detect_signal -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"duration": 10}'
   ```

2. **Synchronize Data**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/sync -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"transaction_id": "12345", "data": "This is a test transaction."}'
   ```

3. **Analyze Signal**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/analyze_signal -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"signal": "Anomalous signal detected!"}'
   ```

4. **Assess Threat**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/assess_threat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": "Sensitive transaction data."}'
   ```

5. **Set Sync Attempts**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/set_sync_attempts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"attempts": 3}'
   ```

## Components

- **Signal Detector**: Responsible for detecting quantum signals from space.
- **Blockchain Synchronization**: Manages synchronization with external blockchain networks.
- **AI Security**: Analyzes signals and data for security threats.
- **API**: A RESTful API for interacting with the EBS module.

## API Documentation

The EBS API provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /detect_signal**: Detect a signal from space.
- **POST /sync**: Synchronize data with the external blockchain network.
- **POST /analyze_signal**: Analyze a detected signal for security purposes.
- **POST /assess_threat**: Assess the threat level of the data being synchronized.
- **POST /set_sync_attempts**: Set the maximum number of sync attempts.

## Configuration

The EBS module uses a JSON configuration file (`ebs_config.json`) to manage settings. You can customize parameters such as logging levels, signal detection thresholds, and synchronization policies.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the EBS module, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s ebs/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and report the results.
