# Bio-Quantum Privacy Layer (BQPL)

## Description

The Bio-Quantum Privacy Layer (BQPL) is an advanced privacy framework designed to protect sensitive biological data using quantum-resistant cryptography and quantum key distribution (QKD). BQPL integrates biosensors and edge computing to ensure secure data collection, processing, and transmission, making it suitable for applications in healthcare, personal monitoring, and other sensitive domains.

## Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Utilizes lattice-based encryption to secure sensitive biological data against quantum attacks.
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Implements secure key exchange mechanisms to enhance data security.
- **Biosensor Integration**: Collects biological data (e.g., heart rate, temperature) from biosensors.
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data locally to reduce latency and enhance privacy.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures the integrity and validity of collected data.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides detailed logging of operations for transparency and auditing.

## Installation

To set up the BQPL, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/bqpl
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Configuration**:
   - Update the `bqpl_config.yaml` file with your specific settings, including encryption parameters and biosensor configurations.

## Usage

### Running the BQPL

You can run the BQPL manager to collect and process biological data:

```python
from bqpl.bqpl_manager import BQPLManager

# Define encryption parameters
encryption_params = {
    'p': 3,
    'q': 32,
    'N': 11
}

# Create a BQPL Manager instance
bqpl_manager = BQPLManager(node_id="EdgeNode_1", sensor_id="Biosensor_1", encryption_params=encryption_params)

# Collect and process data
encrypted_data = bqpl_manager.collect_and_process_data()
print(f"Encrypted Data: {encrypted_data}")

# Decrypt the data
decrypted_data = bqpl_manager.decrypt_data(encrypted_data)
print(f"Decrypted Data: {decrypted_data}")
```

### Configuration

The configuration for the BQPL is managed through the `bqpl_config.yaml` file. You can adjust parameters such as:

- **Encryption Parameters**: Settings for quantum-resistant encryption.
- **Logging Configuration**: Control logging levels and output.
- **Biosensor Settings**: Configure biosensor identifiers and data formats.
- **Edge Node Settings**: Define edge node parameters and processing limits.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the BQPL components, you can use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
