## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd market_analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings (see `.env` for an example).

## Usage

### Data Exploration
- Open the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to explore the historical market data and visualize trends.

### Model Training
- Use the `model_training.ipynb` notebook to train the machine learning model. This notebook will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it for future predictions.

### Making Predictions
- Use the `model_prediction.py` script to load the trained model and make predictions based on new input data.

### API (Optional)
- If you want to serve predictions via an API, you can run the `api.py` script. Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file.

## Running Tests
To ensure the functionality of the application, run the unit tests located in the `tests/` directory:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
