# Tachyonic Communication Protocol and Quantum Processing

## Overview

The **Tachyonic Communication Protocol (TCP)** is a high-speed communication framework designed for quantum nodes, enabling secure and efficient data transmission using advanced quantum communication techniques. This project integrates classical and quantum computing paradigms, providing tools for data manipulation, machine learning, and quantum processing.

## Features

- **Tachyonic Nodes**: Implementations for sending and receiving data packets.
- **Quantum Nodes**: Capabilities for preparing and manipulating quantum states.
- **Protocols**: Well-defined communication protocols for both classical and quantum data.
- **Synchronization**: Mechanisms to ensure time synchronization across nodes.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Tools for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Web3 Support**: Interaction with Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Efficient handling of I/O operations.

## Installation

To set up the Tachyonic Communication Protocol and Quantum Processing system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/tcp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Qiskit**:
   The system uses Qiskit for quantum processing. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   ```

## Getting Started

To start using the system, you can run the main application or perform simulations. The entry point for the application is located in `tcp/main.py`.

### Running the Application
```bash
python tcp/main.py
```

### Running Simulations
To run the simulations, execute:
```bash
python simulations/tachyon_simulation.py
```

## Key Components

### TachyonNode
The `TachyonNode` class represents a node in the Tachyonic Communication Protocol. It handles sending and receiving data packets.

### QuantumNode
The `QuantumNode` class represents a quantum node capable of performing quantum operations.

### TachyonProtocol
The `TachyonProtocol` class defines the communication protocol for the Tachyonic nodes.

### QuantumProtocol
The `QuantumProtocol` class manages the quantum communication protocols.

### Synchronization
The `Synchronization` class ensures that all nodes are synchronized in time.

## Usage Examples

### Sending Data
To send data from one node to another:
```python
sender_node.send_data(receiver_node, data_packet)
```

### Preparing a Quantum State
To prepare a quantum state in a quantum node:
```python
quantum_node.prepare_state([1, 0])  # Example for |0> state
```

### Simulating Communication
To simulate communication between two quantum nodes:
```python
await quantum_node1.send_quantum_data(quantum_node2, quantum_state)
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the system, execute:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
