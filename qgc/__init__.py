Quantum Gravitational Consensus (QGC) Module
This module implements the Quantum Gravitational Consensus mechanism,
which utilizes quantum gravity sensors to achieve ultra-fast and secure consensus
across nodes, including satellite-based nodes in space.

Key Components:
- QuantumGravitySensor: Measures gravitational fluctuations with high precision.
- NodeCommunication: Facilitates communication between nodes for data sharing.
- QuantumGravitationalConsensus: Implements the consensus algorithm based on gravitational measurements.
- QGCManager: Manages the overall QGC operations and coordinates interactions between components.
- QGCUtils: Provides utility functions for data validation, logging, and other operations.

Features:
- High-precision gravitational measurements.
- Secure and efficient node communication.
- Robust consensus algorithm that adapts to measurement discrepancies.
- Integration with space-based node networks for real-time consensus.
- Logging and monitoring for transparency and auditing.

Usage:
To use the QGC module, import the necessary components and initialize them as needed.

Example:
```python
from qgc import QuantumGravitySensor, NodeCommunication, QuantumGravitationalConsensus, QGCManager

# Initialize components
sensor = QuantumGravitySensor(sensor_id="QGS_1")
communication = NodeCommunication(node_id="Node_1")
consensus = QuantumGravitationalConsensus()
manager = QGCManager()

# Measure gravity and participate in consensus
measurement = sensor.measure_gravity()
communication.send_measurement(measurement, target_node)
consensus.add_measurement(measurement)
consensus.reach_consensus()
