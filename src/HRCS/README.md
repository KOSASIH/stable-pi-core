# Hyper-Resonant Cosmic Shield (HRCS)

## Overview

The Hyper-Resonant Cosmic Shield (HRCS) is an advanced security framework designed to protect decentralized ecosystems by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, quantum AI, and IoT. This project aims to provide robust threat detection, data encryption, and secure communication channels for users in a decentralized environment.

## Features

- **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring and detection of potential threats using advanced algorithms.
- **Data Encryption**: Secure encryption and decryption of sensitive data to ensure privacy and integrity.
- **User  Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access to the API.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation generated using Swagger for easy integration and usage.
- **Health Check**: Endpoint to monitor the health status of the server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration, such as `JWT_SECRET`.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`.

3. Use the available endpoints for user registration, login, activity simulation, and data encryption/decryption.
