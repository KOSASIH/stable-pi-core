# Neutrino-Based Communication Array (NBCA)

The Neutrino-Based Communication Array (NBCA) module is an advanced system designed to facilitate communication using neutrino detection technology. By leveraging the unique properties of neutrinos, which can penetrate matter without significant interaction, the NBCA aims to enable robust data transmission in various environments, including terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings.

## Features

- **Neutrino Detection**: Detects neutrino events using advanced detection algorithms.
- **Quantum Processing**: Utilizes a Photonic Quantum Processor Network for data processing and secure communication.
- **Communication Protocols**: Implements robust protocols for encoding, decoding, and transmitting data.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with the NBCA module.
- **Configurable Settings**: Flexible configuration options for logging, detection thresholds, and communication parameters.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Installation

To set up the NBCA module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/nbca
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the configuration**:
   Create a `nbca_config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "LOGGING_LEVEL": "INFO",
       "NEUTRINO_DETECTION_THRESHOLD": 0.1,
       "MAX_COMMUNICATION_ATTEMPTS": 5,
       "NEUTRINO_DETECTOR_TYPE": "IceCube",
       "QUANTUM_PROCESSOR_TYPE": "Photonic",
       "DATA_FORMAT": "JSON"
   }
   ```

## Usage

To run the NBCA module, you can start the API server:

```bash
python nbca/api.py
```

### Example API Requests

1. **Detect Event**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/detect_event
   ```

2. **Process Event**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/process_event -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"event_id": "NEUTRINO-1234", "energy": 0.001, "direction": {"theta": 1.57, "phi": 3.14}}'
   ```

3. **Send Data**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/send_data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"destination": "http://example.com/api", "data": {"event_id": "NEUTRINO-1234", "classification": "Medium Energy"}}'
   ```

4. **Receive Data**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/receive_data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"encoded_data": "your_encoded_data_here"}'
   ```

## Components

- **Neutrino Detector**: Responsible for detecting neutrino events.
- **Quantum Processor**: Manages quantum processing of data and entanglement.
- **Communication Protocol**: Handles encoding, decoding, and transmission of data.
- **Data Processing**: Processes and analyzes detected neutrino events.

## API Documentation

The NBCA API provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /detect_event**: Detect a neutrino event.
- **POST /process_event**: Process a detected neutrino event.
- **POST /send_data**: Send processed data to a specified destination.
- **POST /receive_data**: Receive encoded data from a source.

## Configuration

The NBCA module uses a JSON configuration file (`nbca_config.json`) to manage settings. You can customize parameters such as logging levels, signal detection thresholds, and communication policies.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the NBCA module, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s nbca/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and report the results.
