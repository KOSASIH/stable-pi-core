"""
AI-Driven Predictive Governance Module for Stable Pi Core

This module provides functionalities for implementing an AI-driven predictive governance system
that analyzes data from various sources to provide proactive recommendations to a Decentralized
Autonomous Organization (DAO) before voting begins.

Modules:
- data_collection: Functions for collecting on-chain and off-chain data.
- data_preprocessing: Functions for preprocessing the collected data.
- model: Functions for defining, training, and evaluating the predictive model.
- predictions: Functions for generating predictions and recommendations based on the model.
- governance_dashboard: Functions for creating a Community-Driven Governance Dashboard.
- utils: Utility functions for the AI-driven governance module.
