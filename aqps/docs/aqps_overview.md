# Astro-Quantum Privacy Shield (AQPS) Overview

## Introduction

The Astro-Quantum Privacy Shield (AQPS) is an advanced privacy feature designed to secure data and transactions in space environments. By leveraging Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) through satellite technology, AQPS provides a robust layer of encryption that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information transmitted in orbit.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of AQPS is to:
- Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during transmission.
- Utilize quantum cryptography to generate secure encryption keys.
- Ensure that data integrity is maintained through blockchain technology.

## Architecture

The AQPS architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide a secure communication framework:

1. **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**:
   - Utilizes satellites (e.g., Micius satellite) to distribute quantum keys securely.
   - Ensures that keys are generated and shared in a way that is theoretically immune to eavesdropping.

2. **Edge Computing**:
   - Processes data close to its source, reducing latency and improving efficiency.
   - Utilizes the quantum keys for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Logs transactions and key exchanges on a blockchain to ensure transparency and immutability.
   - Provides a tamper-proof record of all operations involving sensitive data.

## Components

The AQPS feature is implemented through several modules:

- **qkd_client.py**: Interacts with the satellite API to request quantum keys.
- **edge_node.py**: Handles data processing, encryption, and decryption using the quantum keys.
- **encryption.py**: Implements the encryption and decryption logic using AES encryption.
- **blockchain_integration.py**: Manages logging of transactions to the blockchain.
- **config.py**: Contains configuration settings, including API URLs and keys.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions for logging, error handling, and other common tasks.

## Usage

To use the AQPS feature, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
   - `SATELLITE_API_URL`: The URL of the satellite QKD service.
   - `BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL`: The URL of the blockchain service.
   - `QUANTUM_KEY`: (Optional) A default quantum key for testing purposes.

2. **Initialize the QKD Client**:
   Create an instance of the `QKDClient` class to request quantum keys from the satellite.

   ```python
   from aqps.qkd_client import QKDClient

   qkd_client = QKDClient("http://your-satellite-api-url.com")
   quantum_key = qkd_client.request_quantum_key()
   ```

3. **Process Data with Edge Node**:
   Use the `EdgeNode` class to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.

   ```python
   from aqps.edge_node import EdgeNode

   edge_node = EdgeNode(quantum_key)
   encrypted_data = edge_node.process_data("Sensitive information")
   original_data = edge_node.retrieve_data(encrypted_data)
   ```

4. **Log Transactions to Blockchain**:
   Use the `BlockchainIntegration` class to log transactions related to quantum keys and encrypted data.

   ```python
   from aqps.blockchain_integration import BlockchainIntegration

   blockchain = BlockchainIntegration("http://your-blockchain-api-url.com")
   transaction_data = {
       "quantum_key": quantum_key,
       "encrypted_data": encrypted_data,
       "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
   }
   transaction_id = blockchain.log_transaction(transaction_data)
   ```

## Conclusion

The Astro-Quantum Privacy Shield (AQPS) feature represents a significant advancement in securing data in space environments. By combining quantum cryptography, edge computing, and blockchain technology, AQPS provides a comprehensive solution for protecting sensitive information during transmission.
