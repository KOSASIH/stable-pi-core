# Astro-Quantum Privacy Shield (AQPS)

## Overview

The Astro-Quantum Privacy Shield (AQPS) is an advanced privacy feature designed to secure data and transactions in space environments. By leveraging Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) through satellite technology, AQPS provides a robust layer of encryption that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information transmitted in orbit.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Securely generates and distributes cryptographic keys using quantum mechanics.
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data close to its source, reducing latency and enhancing security.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Logs transactions and key exchanges on a blockchain for transparency and immutability.
- **Encryption**: Utilizes advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.

## Architecture

The AQPS architecture consists of several key components:

- **QKD Client**: Interacts with the satellite API to request quantum keys.
- **Edge Node**: Handles data processing, encryption, and decryption using the quantum keys.
- **Encryption Module**: Implements encryption and decryption logic using AES encryption.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Manages logging of transactions to the blockchain.
- **Configuration**: Contains configuration settings, including API URLs and keys.
- **Utilities**: Provides utility functions for logging, error handling, and other common tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/aqps
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   SATELLITE_API_URL=http://your-satellite-api-url.com
   BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL=http://your-blockchain-api-url.com
   QUANTUM_KEY=your_default_quantum_key  # Optional
   ```

## Usage

To use the AQPS feature, you can run the example usage script:

```bash
python examples/example_usage.py
```

This script demonstrates how to request a quantum key, encrypt and decrypt data, process data with the edge node, and log transactions to the blockchain.

## Simulation

To simulate space-like conditions and test the AQPS components, run the following script:

```bash
python examples/simulation.py
```

This script simulates variable latency and potential noise in communication, mimicking conditions that might be encountered in space.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the AQPS components, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
