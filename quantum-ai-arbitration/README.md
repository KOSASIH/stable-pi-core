# Quantum and AI Arbitration Project

## Overview

The **Quantum and AI Arbitration Project** aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies in quantum computing and artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making processes in arbitration systems. By integrating quantum algorithms with machine learning models, this project seeks to improve efficiency, accuracy, and security in arbitration scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Solver**: Implements quantum algorithms for optimization problems.
- **Predictive Model**: Uses machine learning to predict outcomes based on historical data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies potential fraud in transaction data.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk associated with arbitration cases.
- **Arbitration Service**: Integrates all components to process arbitration cases.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/quantum-ai-arbitration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Use the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script**
   The setup script will install any additional dependencies and prepare the environment.
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup.py
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration files for different environments are located in the `config/` directory. You can modify the following files based on your environment:

- `development.yaml`: Configuration for the development environment.
- `production.yaml`: Configuration for the production environment.
- `testing.yaml`: Configuration for the testing environment.

### Example of Loading Configuration

You can load the configuration in your application as follows:

```python
import yaml

def load_config(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return config

# Load the development configuration
config = load_config('config/development.yaml')
```

## Running the Application

To run the quantum simulation and process arbitration cases, use the following command:

```bash
python scripts/run_simulation.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Example: Using the Quantum Solver

```python
from quantum.quantum_solver import QuantumSolver

# Initialize the quantum solver
solver = QuantumSolver(backend='qasm_simulator', shots=1024)

# Define a sample optimization problem
problem = [100, 200, 300]

# Solve the optimization problem
result = solver.solve_optimization(problem)
print("Optimization Result:", result)
```

### Example: Using the Predictive Model

```python
from ai.predictive_model import PredictiveModel

# Initialize the predictive model
model = PredictiveModel(model_path='./models/predictive_model.pkl')

# Train the model with sample data
data = {
    'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'feature2': [4, 5, 6, 7],
    'target': [0, 1, 0, 1]
}
model.train(data)

# Predict the outcome
prediction = model.predict_outcome({'feature1': 3, 'feature2': 6})
print("Predicted Outcome:", prediction)
```

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will execute all the unit and integration tests defined in the `tests/` directory.
