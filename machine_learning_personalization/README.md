## Project Overview

The system collects data from IoT devices, processes it, and uses machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations to users. The project includes data collection, cleaning, storage in a database, and model training.

## Features

- Simulates user behavior data collection from IoT devices.
- Cleans and processes the collected data.
- Stores cleaned data in a SQLite database.
- Trains a K-Nearest Neighbors recommendation model.
- Provides recommendations based on user behavior patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **SQLite**: For database storage.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model training.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/machine_learning_personalization
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Run the `main.py` script to collect user behavior data, clean it, store it in the database, and train the recommendation model.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training:
   - `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`: Explore and visualize the user behavior data.
   - `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`: Train the recommendation model and evaluate its performance.

3. **Database Interaction**: The cleaned data will be stored in a SQLite database named `user_behavior.db`. You can query this database for further analysis.
