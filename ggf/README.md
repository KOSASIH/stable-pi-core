# Galactic Governance Framework (GGF)

The Galactic Governance Framework (GGF) is a sophisticated system designed to facilitate decentralized governance across various planets and star systems. By leveraging advanced technologies such as the Tachyonic Communication Protocol, smart contracts, and a robust voting system, GGF enables communities to manage their affairs efficiently and transparently.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting System**: Allows community members to propose and vote on decisions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates governance processes, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Tachyonic Communication Protocol**: Facilitates real-time communication across vast distances.
- **Decision Engine**: Processes voting results and executes decisions based on outcomes.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks all actions and decisions for accountability.

## Installation

To set up the GGF module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd stable-pi-core/ggf
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the configuration**:
   Create a `ggf_config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "LOGGING_LEVEL": "INFO",
       "VOTING_TIMEOUT": 3600,
       "MIN_VOTES_REQUIRED": 10,
       "MAX_PROPOSALS": 100,
       "COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL": "Tachyonic",
       "SPACE_TIME_SYNC_ENABLED": true
   }
   ```

## Usage

To use the GGF module, you can initialize the components in your application:

```python
from ggf import voting_system, decision_engine, smart_contracts, communication

# Example of proposing a new governance decision
proposal_id = "Proposal-001"
proposal_details = "Establish a new trade route between Planet A and Planet B."
voting_system.propose(proposal_id, proposal_details)

# Example of casting a vote
voter_id = "Voter-123"
vote = True  # Yes vote
voting_system.vote(proposal_id, voter_id, vote)

# Example of tallying votes
result = voting_system.tally_votes(proposal_id)
decision_engine.execute_decision(proposal_id, result)

# Example of sending a message
communication.send_message("Proposal has been approved.", "Planet B")
```

## Components

- **Voting System**: Manages proposals and voting processes.
- **Decision Engine**: Executes decisions based on voting results.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates governance actions and ensures compliance.
- **Communication**: Facilitates message sending and receiving across planets.

## Configuration

The GGF module uses a JSON configuration file (`ggf_config.json`) to manage settings. You can customize parameters such as logging levels, voting timeouts, and communication protocols.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the GGF module, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s ggf/tests
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and report the results.
